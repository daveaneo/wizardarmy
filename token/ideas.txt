> We want to limit our active wizards to role, at some point. In other words, we don't want 6000 general wizards. We will
want, for example, 5 solidity devs, 10 designers, 100 marketers, and so forth. There should be a constraint on who can initialize.
They will need to be initialized with a role.
>> more functions -- must initialize with role
