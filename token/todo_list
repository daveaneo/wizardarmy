Contracts:
> Wizards
  ✅ Make it so each wizard can have up to one role
  ✅ Make it so external appointer can give wizard this role. This would likely be a smart contract in which certain roles had power to give other roles to users.
  - Potentially have (updateable) values for
    • Mana/Wizard Gold (how many tokens are in your account)
    ✅ Level
    • Tasks complete / contributions
    ✅ Element (fire, wind, water, earth)
    ✅ role (designer, writer, influencer, et cetera)-- I'm thinking 1 role max per NFT. Role can be changed.
    ✅ Upline (either number or wizard image)
    ✅ Wizard Id
  - Stages
    • Uninitiated
    • Exiled
    • "Egg"
    • Wizard -> Can join wizard tower



> WizardTower
  - Same value for all wizards
> WizardGold
  - Updateable threshold for when to add liquidity
  - Update tokenomics
  - No antiwhale (maybe refresh token from original source)

> Crowdsale
> Approver
  - What is this? Tasking/governance?
✅ Appointer (to do) contract that assigns roles to users (roles can be updated)
> Governance (Change to Tasker)
  - Remove voting and put in its own contract
  - Each task group will have its own tasker contract
  - Default tasker for everyone with easy tasks so there is always a way to participate
